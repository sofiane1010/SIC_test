first produced trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy chronologically media interviews past explained movies made order recall reasons film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy second trilogy well know mean order review thorough many significant points must mentioned unfortunately serve spoilers proceed caution first catalog know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know kenobi
